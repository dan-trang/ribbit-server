# Ribbit v.1

Ribbit is my first attempt at a fullstack web application built from back to front. The boilerplate is thanks to **Ben Awad** @https://github.com/benawad/lireddit. He has great video walkthrough on youtube. The purpose of rebuilding his code is to:
1. Get hands on experience and exposure to building the entire stack
1. Seeing all the moving parts of a web application
1. Learning new frameworks and languages
1. Using the boilerplate code as a launch pad to further develop/customize/learn on my own

The short term goal by the end of this project is to get an overview all the moving parts of a web application and to pick up new frameworks and languages. The long term goal is to further expand on the baseline web application and use it as a sandbox to experiment and learn more.
